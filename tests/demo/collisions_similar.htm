<h2>Similar collisions</h2>
This test is designed to act as a simple benchmark for box->plane,
box->box, sphere->plane, sphere-sphere, capsule->plane and capsule->capsule collisions.<br />
Should be used to measure the performance impact of optimisations,
changes to the codebase and browser updates.<br />
